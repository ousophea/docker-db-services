**Understanding the Docker Compose File**

This Docker Compose file defines a multi-container application consisting of two services: `sample_mysql` and `phpmyadmin`. They are interconnected using a custom network named `external_network`.

**Breakdown of the Services:**

1. **`sample_mysql`:**
   - **Image:** Uses the latest MySQL image.
   - **Restart Policy:** Restarts the container unless it's stopped manually.
   - **Environment Variables:** Sets the root password and database name for MySQL.
   - **Port Mapping:** Exposes port 3306 of the container to port 3306 of the host machine.
   - **Volumes:**
     - Persists the MySQL data directory to the host machine's `sample_mysql` directory.
     - Mounts a SQL script to initialize the database on container startup.
   - **Networks:** Connects the container to the `external_network`.

2. **`phpmyadmin`:**
   - **Image:** Uses the official PHPMyAdmin image.
   - **Port Mapping:** Exposes port 80 of the container to port 8383 of the host machine.
   - **Restart Policy:** Always restarts the container.
   - **Environment Variables:** Configures PHPMyAdmin to connect to the `sample_mysql` container and sets the root password.
   - **Networks:** Connects the container to the `external_network`.

**The `external_network`:**

- **External:** Declares the network as external, meaning it's not managed by Docker Compose itself. It's likely created manually using the `docker network create` command with the provided configuration.
- **Purpose:** This network allows the two containers to communicate with each other without relying on host networking. This is a more secure and flexible approach, especially in complex environments.

**How it Works:**

1. **Network Creation:** A custom network named `external_network` is created outside of Docker Compose. This network provides a shared namespace for the containers to communicate.
2. **Container Startup:**
   - Docker Compose starts the `sample_mysql` container, exposing its MySQL service on the `external_network`.
   - It then starts the `phpmyadmin` container, configuring it to connect to the `sample_mysql` container using the `external_network`.
3. **Communication:**
   - The `phpmyadmin` container can access the MySQL service of the `sample_mysql` container through the `external_network`. This allows PHPMyAdmin to manage and query the database.

By using this approach, you can create a more isolated and flexible environment for your application, especially when dealing with multiple services that need to interact with each other.
